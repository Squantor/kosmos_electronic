# Kosmos electronic SOT23 transistor
Kosmos electronic generic SOT23 transistor, as far as I know most SOT23 transistors, BJT or MOSFET, all have the same pinout.
1. Base or Gate
2. Emitter or Source
3. Collector or Drain
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Manufacturing
* Test
* Pictures
## BOM
* Kosmos electronic uses some special pins for the connections, I have found something similar by [Mill-max 6092](https://www.mill-max.com/catalog/download/2020-10%3A207M.pdf) available at [digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mill-max-manufacturing-corp/6092-0-00-15-00-00-33-0/1991698)
* BC547 style PNP transistor
