This directory contains mostly reproductions or new modules for the Kosmos electronics experiment kits. The schematics and PCB's are drawn in kicad. Most of the modules are described in "unit cells". The transistor modules are one unit cell large. The MW/AM module and opamp module are two unit cells large.
